# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design is implemented in this Portfolio Project. When the viewport is small (phone - portrait) images take the full width and as the width increases the desgin responds accordingly.

Bootstrap was used to build the About Me, Portfolio, and Contact pages with navbar, responsive layout and images.
